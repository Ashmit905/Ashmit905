## Hi there  I'm Ashmit!👋

I'm a third-year university student at the University Of Guelph pursuing a career in Software Engineering. Here you'll see my new projects as I upload them daily. Other than Programming, some interests I have include lifting at the Gym or playing Basketball🏀. I can be reached on my school email asharm58@uoguelph.ca or reachashmitsharma@gmail.com
