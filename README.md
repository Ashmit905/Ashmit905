## Hi there  I'm Ashmit!👋

I'm a third-year university student at the University Of Guelph pursuing a career in Software Engineering. Here you'll see my new projects as I upload them daily. Other than programming, some interests I have include lifting at the Gym or playing Basketball 🏀. I'm also a STEAM Director/Coding Instructor at the City of Brampton striving to help individuals with the desire to pursue a career in STEM to succeed and be a caring leader while fostering friendships youths will remember for life. I can be reached on my school email asharm58@uoguelph.ca or reachashmitsharma@gmail.com
